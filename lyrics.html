            Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
            Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
            Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            Because I'm easy come, easy go
            Little high, little low
            Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

            Mama, just killed a man
            Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
            Mama, life had just begun
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away
            Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

            Too late, my time has come
            Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
            Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
            I don't wanna die
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

            I see a little silhouetto of a man
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
            Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
            (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
            But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity
            Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
            بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
            No, we will not let you go (let him go)
            بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
            We will not let you go (let him go)
            بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
            We will not let you go (let me go)
            Will not let you go (let me go)
            Will not let you go (never, never, never, never let me go)
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no
            Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
            Mamma mia, let me go
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
            Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
            Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

            Ooh
            Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
            Nothing really matters, anyone can see
            Nothing really matters
            Nothing really matters to me
